* We're not really mocking the whole class here, we're really just doing a partial mock on the methods that you stub.
* Because we're not really mocking the whole class, verify is a bit awkward... we can't just always "watch" all interations with the class since we're not mocking all the methods. So instead
we have to specify what methods we want to expect. We can also expect any method that is stubbed, but this COULD be redundant see -> (http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/04/26/asking-and-telling/)
* Maybe check into not using exceptions since the SenTest framework kind of acts odd with them, not showing the specific test it errored in.
* Future additions:
    * Parameter matching/verification
    * Verify methods NEVER run
    * Verify methods run at least # of times (>=)
    * Verify methods run no more than # of times (<)

Needs to happen now:
    * Copy the headers into a Headers director. Maybe make a /lib dir and in there have the "Headers" folder and the .a file
